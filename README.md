## My process

 firstly i visualized the tools im going to make the design and then i made research on how to fetch data from a JSON FILE,with the little knowledge i got on it, i was able to collect them and manipulate them into the DOM

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- javascript
- frontend mentor design layout

### What I learned

I improved on my 'display flex' skills and 'position'.Mapping the JSON datas out was a very hard task but im glad i was able to get a bit of it and complete the project

```js

fetch('data.json')

 .then(response=> response.json())
   .then((data) => {

let Data=data;
 ...
}
```

### Continued development

I will like to get better in working with fetching JSON from an external file and also get improve my CSS skills

### Useful resources
